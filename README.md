# Drawing Application

This project is a Java-based drawing application that allows users to draw and manipulate geometric shapes on a digital canvas.

## Project Description
The application is built using Java Swing and AWT and focuses on event-driven programming through real-time mouse interactions. It demonstrates the use of Graphics2D for rendering, coordinate handling, and object-oriented design to manage different drawing tools and states.

## Key Features
- Interactive drawing of geometric shapes  
- Smooth rendering using Graphics2D  
- Mouse event handling with MouseListener and MouseMotionListener  
- Tool and state management for drawing operations  

## Tech Stack
- Language: Java  
- IDE: Eclipse  
- Libraries: javax.swing, java.awt  

## Project Structure
- `src/` : Java source code (GUI, event handling, drawing logic)  
- `report/` : Project documentation and analysis
